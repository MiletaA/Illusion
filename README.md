## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to "Illusion" an ambitious project aimed at transforming social media through the power of Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to create a platform where content is generated and personalized exclusively by AI, moving from images to eventually videos.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The vision of Illusion is to provide users with an entirely new experience of social media. By relying on AI-generated content and intelligent algorithms, we aim to offer highly personalized content that evolves according to user preferences.

## ðŸš€ Current Stage & Future Development
Currently, we are laying down the groundwork. The key areas of focus include:
- Implementing a login/register system
- Creating personalized content boxes
- Developing a For You Page (FYP) and recommendation system
- Enhancing algorithms for tailored content delivery
- Adding report and comment functionalities

### Data Source
Data plays a vital role in this project. We are utilizing the [midjourney-texttoimage-new](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nateraw/midjourney-texttoimage-new) dataset from Hugging Face to fuel our AI engines.

## ðŸ’¡ Collaboration Opportunities
We believe in the power of collaboration. If the intersection of AI and social media excites you, add code you think will be suitable or give some feedback. :)

Best regards!
